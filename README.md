### Business Understanding
The main goal of this project is to collect and analyze student data that contain featutres that determines the likelihood of getting admission for Masters in the university. We will help students check the possibility of getting admitted with their different exam scores.

### Analytical Approach:
This is a supervised regression problem where we will determine the chances of getting admission where 0 is no chance, 1 is very high chance and 0.5 is the cutoff
